text-attributes = [head=1]Levelling info[/head]
            Agents can level up their attributes by doing specific work on abnormalities.

            Different abnormalities like different works, and every abnormality has a unique abililty.

            Working on abnormalities produces energy which you can use to buy gear.

            Different works determine with stat increases:
            Instinct - Fortitude (Max Health)
            Insight - Prudence (Max Sanity)
            Attachment - Temperance (Better work)
            Repression - Justice (Speed and melee damage)

            Gain a stat level every 20 points. Important for stat checks.

text-risk-classes = [head=1]Risk classes[/head]
            Abnormalities are grouped into 5 Risk Classes, in order from most cooperative to a nuclear bomb as follows:
            Zayin, Teth, He, Waw, Aleph.

            Examine the console to see what the level of the abnormality is.

            You can only level up so far on each risk class.
            The formula for this is 20 + 20 x Abnormality level.

            For example, this means that an HE will level you up until 80's in attributes (20 + (3 x 20))

text-damage-types = [head=1]Damage types[/head]
            Damage is split into 4 types for humans, but all do flat damage to abnormalities:
            Red - Deals physical damage to your body. -- Bruises, cuts and all sorts of normal phenomena
            White - Deals sanity damage. -- ???
            Black - Deals a mixture of physical and sanity damage. -- It is acidic in nature
            Pale - Deals a percentage of your max health as damage. -- Limited research is available on pale damage, yet it is theorized it cuts your soul itself

            When your sanity reaches 0 as a result of white or black damage, you will lose control of yourself.

            Abnormalities do small amounts of damage when working on them.
            Examine weapons and armor to see the damage type, amount and resistences.
            Most weapons have stat requirements, and some have special abilities.

text-tips = [head=1]Tips[/head]
            Working on higher level abnormalities will provide more attribute gains.
            Just make sure you can survive the process.

            Ordeals will spawn a horde of enemies or a hard boss.
            Stop working and co-ordinate with others to swiftly take them out before there are sacrifices needed to be made.

            If someone is spouting nonsense, attacking you or moving erratically, they may be insane!
            Hit them with white or black damage to bring them back to their senses, But beware as hitting them with BLACK may cause death.

            You regain health and sanity from regenerators located in main rooms.
            The amount restored can be modified by RAKs.

            The longer the round goes on, the higher attributes agents will have when joining.

            Seeing abnormalities stronger than you will cause you to lose sanity.
